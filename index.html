        <p>
            Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve
            my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start designing
            some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and stored on my cell
            phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more
            sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble)
            made a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that
            the result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.

                        You will start seeing things differently and

                            As designers, we are often afraid of showing
                            work that’s not finished or doesn’t look perfect.
                            You will learn to accept feedback and learn from
                            it.

                    close attention to your surroundings.
